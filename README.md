 In the attached txt file, there are ten 200 by 200 matrices. 
 Using the matrices, write a program as described. 
  1) Each matrix is named A, B, C, D, ..., J respectively. When X(i,j) is the mean of A(i,j), B(i,j), C(i,j), D(i,j), ...,          J(i,j) and Y(i,j) is the median of  A(i,j), B(i,j), C(i,j), D(i,j), ..., J(i,j), you are required to calculate 200 by 200      matrices for mean(X) and median(Y). 
  2) Notice when there are erroneous inputs, you need to correct the input values to be finite real numbers.
  3) The attached file has the following format. Elements of each matrix are separated by "," Each row is separated by ";",        and each matrix is separated by "|". For example, three 2 by 2 matrices are as follows.
     1,2;3,4|0,1;1,0|5,3;3,1|
